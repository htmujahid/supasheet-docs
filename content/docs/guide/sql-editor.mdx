description: Built-in SQL editor for database management
---

## Overview

Supasheet includes a built-in SQL editor that allows you to write and execute SQL queries directly against your database. The editor provides a powerful interface for database management and data analysis.

## Key Features

- **Syntax Highlighting** - Color-coded SQL syntax for better readability
- **Autocomplete** - Intelligent suggestions for tables, columns, and SQL keywords
- **Query History** - Access and re-run previously executed queries
- **Multiple Tabs** - Work on multiple queries simultaneously
- **Export Results** - Download query results as CSV or JSON
- **Saved Queries** - Save and organize frequently used queries

## Row Level Security (RLS)

All queries executed through the SQL editor **respect Row Level Security policies**. This means:

- You only see data you're authorized to access
- RLS policies are automatically applied to your queries
- Queries run with your current user's permissions
- No special privileges are granted through the SQL editor

This ensures data security even when using the SQL editor directly.

## Query Support

The SQL editor **only supports SELECT queries** for data retrieval and analysis.

You can:
- Query tables and views in the `public` schema
- Run analytical queries with joins, aggregations, and filters
- Export query results as CSV or JSON

You cannot:
- INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE records (use CRUD interfaces instead)
- CREATE or ALTER tables (use migrations instead)
- Execute DDL or administrative commands

## Schema Access

Currently, the SQL editor works with the **`public` schema only**.

Views with special metadata (reports, dashboards, charts) are accessed through their respective UI interfaces based on the JSON comment type.

## Common Use Cases

### Data Analysis
Run analytical queries to understand your data, generate insights, and identify trends.

### Data Export
Extract specific datasets by running custom SELECT queries and exporting results.

### Testing Queries
Test and refine SELECT queries before using them in views or reports.

### Ad-hoc Reporting
Create custom data views and reports without creating permanent database objects.

## Security & Best Practices

- **SELECT only** - Only SELECT queries are supported for safety
- **RLS is enforced** - Your queries respect all security policies
- **Limited to public schema** - Only query tables in the public schema
- **No admin privileges** - SQL editor runs with your user permissions, not elevated access
- **Use CRUD for modifications** - For INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE operations, use the auto-generated CRUD interfaces
