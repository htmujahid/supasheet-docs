## What is Supasheet?

Supasheet is a **SQL-based admin panel and CMS built on top of Supabase**. It provides a powerful, code-first approach to building admin interfaces where you primarily write SQL to define your entire application.

### Key Features

- **CRUD Operations**: Define tables and views in SQL, and Supasheet automatically generates the UI
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Leverage Supabase Auth and PostgreSQL Row Level Security (RLS)
- **Charts & Dashboards**: Create visualizations using SQL views in dedicated schemas
- **Reports**: Generate reports from SQL queries
- **Audit Logs**: Track changes automatically using PostgreSQL triggers
- **Widgets**: Build custom widgets powered by SQL
- **Storage Management**: File upload and management with Supabase Storage
- **SQL Editor**: Built-in SQL editor for database management

### How It Works

Supasheet leverages Supabase's core features:

- **PostgREST**: Automatic REST API from your PostgreSQL database
- **Supabase Auth**: Built-in authentication with JWT
- **Supabase Storage**: File storage management
- **Row Level Security (RLS)**: PostgreSQL policies for authorization
- **Realtime**: Real-time subscriptions (where applicable)

The frontend (Next.js 15 + React 19) dynamically renders interfaces based on your database schema. You define the data model and business logic in SQL, and Supasheet handles the UI layer.
