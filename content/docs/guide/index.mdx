## What is Supasheet?

Supasheet is a **complete CMS platform built on Supabase**. It's an opinionated, full-fledged open-source CMS with everything included. Go beyond basic admin panels with built-in authentication, dashboards, charts, reports, file management, and comprehensive data tools.

It provides a powerful, SQL-first approach where you primarily write SQL to define your application, and Supasheet handles the UI layer automatically.

### Key Features

- **Authentication**: Complete user authentication system with Supabase Auth
- **User Management**: Comprehensive user administration and profile management
- **Authorization (RBAC)**: Role-based access control with PostgreSQL Row Level Security
- **Resource (CRUD)**: Auto-generated CRUD interfaces from your database schema
- **Data Views**: Multiple view types - Sheet, Kanban, Calendar, and Gallery
- **Customizable UI**: Flexible theming and component customization
- **SQL Editor**: Built-in SQL editor for direct database management
- **Dashboard**: Customizable dashboards for data visualization
- **Analytics**: Built-in analytics and metrics tracking
- **Reports**: Generate custom reports from SQL queries
- **Charts**: Create visualizations using SQL views
- **File Storage**: Complete file upload and management with Supabase Storage
- **Audit Logs**: Automatic change tracking using PostgreSQL triggers

### How It Works

Supasheet is built on top of Supabase's powerful features:

- **PostgREST**: Automatic REST API from your PostgreSQL database
- **Supabase Auth**: Built-in authentication with JWT and social providers
- **Supabase Storage**: Complete file storage and CDN management
- **Row Level Security (RLS)**: PostgreSQL policies for fine-grained authorization
- **Realtime**: Real-time subscriptions for live data updates

The frontend (Next.js 16 + React 19) dynamically renders a complete CMS interface based on your database schema. You define your data model and business logic in SQL, and Supasheet automatically generates:

- CRUD interfaces for all tables
- Multiple data view types (Sheet, Kanban, Calendar, Gallery)
- Dashboards and analytics
- Reports and charts
- File management UI
- User administration
